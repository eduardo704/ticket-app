# TicketApp

Hi Everyone at Visory, I created this app in Angular, so it is a default angular app. I tried not use any viusal library and focused more on the requirements. Here is the full app.

# Setup

npm install

# running

npm run start

# testing

npm run test

# live app

Also the live version is avaliable at: https://ticket-app-7a725.web.app/

Thanks for the opportunity, cheers Eduardo.
