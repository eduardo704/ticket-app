# TicketApp

Hi Everyone at Visory, I created this app in Angular, so to run it after installing the dependecies with npm i, just run npm run start. The same for testing, just run npm run test. I introduced jest as I think it is best.

Also the live version is avaliable at: https://ticket-app-7a725.web.app/

Thanks for the opportunity, cheers Eduardo.
